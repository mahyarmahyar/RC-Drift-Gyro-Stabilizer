# RC Drift Gyro Stabilizer

An advanced gyro-based steering stabilization system for RC drift cars, designed using the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and MPU6050 gyroscope. This project integrates precise steering corrections, remote control functionality, and visual feedback using an RGB LED.

## Features

- **Gyroscope Integration (MPU6050):** Provides real-time stabilization to enhance RC drift performance.
- **Servo Steering Control:** Smooth and precise adjustments to the steering angle.
- **Remote Control Input:** Seamlessly integrates with standard RC remote signals.
- **RGB LED Feedback:** Visual indicators for system states:
  - **Red:** System boot-up.
  - **Blue:** Gyro-based stabilization active.
  - **Green:** Remote control input active.
- **Noise Reduction:** Filters and calibration for smooth operation and reduced jitter.

## How It Works

1. **Gyroscope Calibration:**
   - On startup, the gyroscope (MPU6050) is calibrated to minimize offset.
   
2. **Remote and Gyro Control:**
   - The system prioritizes input from the remote control.
   - When remote input is inactive, the gyro takes over to stabilize the steering.

3. **Visual Feedback:**
   - The RGB LED indicates the current system state, helping to debug and monitor the system.
